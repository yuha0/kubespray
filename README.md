# Deploy a Production Ready Kubernetes Cluster

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Although the upstream [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray) [has never officially support multi-arch installation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray/issues/8755#issuecomment-1111865995), it had worked in multi-arch environments pretty well for a very long time with minimal effort. This fork tracks all my hacks to make it work in my homelab.
